        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I am a recent Computer Science graduate out of CSU Monterey Bay. While I was in school, 
            I studied various disciplines such as web development, database design and management, 
            algorithms, operating systems, programmatic image processing and video game development.
            I was also an officer for the school's Game Development Club for 3 semesters right up until
            I graduated.

            While my tech professional carrer is still relatively new, my recent work experience actually
            pushed me towards a role in education. I tutored college level mathematics for 3 years while
            collaborating with professors and mentors to create learning outcomes for the students that 
            attended my self-hosted sessions. My experience tutoring has helped me build proficiency in 
            communicating and demonstrating concepts in both one-on-one and group settings. I also know 
            what it takes to teach understanding to othersâ€” how to connect what someone might already 
            know to a larger concept. With feedback from students, I was also able to cater my lessons 
            to their needs while retaining the core facts and learning requirements.
        </p>

            I would love to continue persuing a teaching position, but that would be a far ways off and 
            doesn't quite align with my passions. My dream job is a videogame developer. I have had a
            lifelong love for the craft and wish to join that medium of storytelling and expression. As I 
            have grown, I've come to realize that my career goals aren't too disimilar to those of an artist.
            I wish to create, show others what I can make, and express who I am in my work. In a world where
            functional tech has become an increasingly dominant force in the world, I suppose I stand in the 
            same position. I am an artist that just so happens to create through technology.
