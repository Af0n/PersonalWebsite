                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a recent Computer Science graduate out of CSU Monterey Bay. While I was in school,
                    I studied various disciplines such as web development, database design and management,
                    algorithms, operating systems, programmatic image processing and video game development.
                    I was also an officer for the school's Game Development Club for 3 semesters right up until
                    I graduated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While my tech professional carrer is still relatively new, my recent work experience actually
                    pushed me towards a role in education. I tutored college level mathematics for 3 years while
                    collaborating with professors and mentors to create learning outcomes for the students that
                    attended my self-hosted sessions. My experience tutoring has helped me build proficiency in
                    communicating and demonstrating concepts in both one-on-one and group settings. I also know
                    what it takes to teach understanding to othersâ€” how to connect what someone might already
                    know to a larger concept. With feedback from students, I was also able to cater my lessons
                    to their needs while retaining the core facts and learning requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think I would be happy with a position in education, but that would be a far ways off and
                    doesn't quite align with my actual passions. My dream job is to develop videogames. I have had a
                    lifelong love for the craft and wish to join that medium of storytelling and expression. As I
                    have grown, I've come to realize that my career goals aren't too disimilar to those of an artist.
                    I wish to create, show others what I can make, and express who I am in my work. In a world where
                    functional tech has become an increasingly dominant force in the world, I suppose I stand in the
                    same position. I am an artist that just so happens to create through technology.

        <h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
        <p>
            I currently find myself in the post-grad struggle of finding a foothold in a chaotic AI-driven
            job market. To fill up my time in between applications, I like to practice my skills with various
            projects. I find value in projects large and small even to just brush up on some basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working on my technical skills, I practice real-time video streaming and production.
            I also serve as community lead and handle user management for multiple large online meeting spaces.
            I will often do case studies on already published videogames as well. These analyze the decisions
            made in presentation, mechanics, monetization, and other factors to see what works and what doesn't
            when it comes to development.
